# Huang2024_EvidenceForUncoupledDynamics
This repository consists of scripts for reproducing results in the "Evidence for transient, uncoupled power and functional connectivity dynamics" manuscript.

## Requirements
- Scripts for training models and analysing results depends on the [osl-dynamics](https://osl-dynamics.readthedocs.io) toolbox, which includes source code for the M-DyNeMo model, as well as analysis tools.

## Contents
```real_data```: This directory contains scripts for training models on real data and analysing results from trained models.

```simulation```: This directory contains scripts for training models on simulation data and analysing results from trained models.
